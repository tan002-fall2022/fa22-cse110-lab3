** Why did you add/fix that? **
A brief reasoning of why you added a feature or fixed a certain bug. If added a feature, include a description of how said new feature will contribute to the project. If you spent time fixing a bug, also include a brief reasoning of why you feel like you have to fix that particular bug.
